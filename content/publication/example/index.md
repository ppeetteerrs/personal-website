abstract: >
  The RISC-V ISA and ecosystem have been becoming an increasingly popular in both industry and academia. gem5 is a widely used powerful simulation platform for computer architecture research. Previous works have added single-core and multi-core RISC-V support to gem5 but only for system call emulation. The full-system simulation of gem5, on the other hand, provides accurate analysis of
  systems as an actual system software is loaded and run on the hardware platform modelled in gem5. However, full-system simulation
  support in gem5 for RISC-V ISA is currently not available. This paper presents our recent work on supporting RISC-V fullsystem simulation in gem5. After describing the implementation details of supporting extensible target system and debugging methodology for overcoming major challenges, we share our experiments
  of full-system simulations.
