These are my study notes for SMU LGST101 Business Law. As a fun fact, I took this course as an exchange student and literally spent no time (aside from making this series) studying for the subject. And certainly, as an engineering student, I did not bother to read any of the cases nor the textbook. Still, I managed to score A and A+ for my midterms and finals respectively. :sunglasses:

I hope this conveys the point that the method of study is some times more important than the time spent. My notes are designed to approach topics from a conceptual level and should be helpful towards crafting an organized and on-point argument in exam.
