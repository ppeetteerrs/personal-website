# 1 Google is My Best Friend

Prior to my FYP, my only experiences with GAN are:

1. Reading Ian Goodfellow's "Deep Learning" book before university
2. A mini class project where we used some random GAN to generate new Pokemons

The first things to do when learning about a new research topic are:
1. Fundamental Theorem of [TOPIC]: understand the most important concepts, intuitions, methodologies, datasets, libraries and tools etc. (get a good grasp of the big picture)
2. [TOPIC (in a broader sense)] Roadmap: understand the necessary skills, ideas, theories etc. to succeed in the field (know what you need to know)
3. State-of-the-art [TOPIC] papers: understand the progression of the field, the important evolution / breakthroughs (get a good sense on how things can be / have been improved historically)
4. Really-awesome-[TOPIC] GitHub: it is somewhat a trend that some kind soul would have collated a (hopefully updated) list of relevant resources, code and papers regarding the topic [typically named really-awesome-xxx] (scan through a comprehensive list of relevant resources to find inspirations, interesting concepts etc.)

# 2 What did I actually search for

- `understanding gan`
- `intuition behind gan`
- `mathematical motivation of gan`
- `gan deep dive`
- `generative adversarial networks roadmap`
- `deep learning roadmap` (I didn't include stuff here, but it is probably good to have some sense on this topic)
- `everything to know about gan`
- `best gan papers`
- `awesome gan`
- `history of generative adversarial networks`
- `progression in generative adversarial networks`
- `evolution of generative adversarial networks`

# 3 What I ended up with
> The [Deep Learning State of the Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53YvP6gdD7U) series is a yearly must-see (if you don't already know about it). Putting it here because it is so important.

After searching with all of the above keywords and scanning through the repos / articles, here are what I ended up with:

## 3.1 Concepts
- [Understanding GAN Loss Functions](https://neptune.ai/blog/gan-loss-functions): I don't need the any basic tutorials because I have some prior knowledge, include those if you are new to the field. But a refresher on the basic mechanism is nice.
- [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Dummies — A Step By Step Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-adversarial-network-gan-for-dummies-a-step-by-step-tutorial-fdefff170391): jks, everyone needs a dummies guide every now and then, doesn't mean you are a dummy
- [Generative Adversarial Networks- History and Overview](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-adversarial-networks-history-and-overview-7effbb713545)
- [The Math Behind GANs](https://jaketae.github.io/study/gan-math/): nice fonts, I copied it over hehe
- [GAN — GAN Series (from the beginning to the end)](https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/gan-gan-series-2d279f906e7b)


## 3.2 Paper Summaries / Lists
- [GAN — A comprehensive review into the gangsters of GANs](https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/gan-a-comprehensive-review-into-the-gangsters-of-gans-part-2-73233a670d19): paper summaries are true time-savers
- [GAN Papers to Read in 2020](https://towardsdatascience.com/gan-papers-to-read-in-2020-2c708af5c0a4)
- [Must-Read Papers on GANs](https://towardsdatascience.com/must-read-papers-on-gans-b665bbae3317)
- [6 GAN Architectures You Really Should Know](https://neptune.ai/blog/6-gan-architectures)

## 3.3 GitHub
- [really-awesome-gan](https://github.com/nightrome/really-awesome-gan): fun fact, the maintainer is Holger Caesar who used to support out events at NTU MLDA (Btw [lmao](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02528) I almost wet my pants)
- [Awesome GAN Papers](https://github.com/ysbsb/awesome-gan-papers)
- [AdversarialNetsPapers](https://github.com/zhangqianhui/AdversarialNetsPapers)
- [GANs World Resources](https://github.com/instillai/Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Roadmap)
- ~~[The GAN Zoo](https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo): its just a (too) long ass list of all GANs zzzz~~
