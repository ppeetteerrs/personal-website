# 1 Overview {#1_overview}

_P.S. I took this course as an exchange student. These notes are made to explain the topics that I found most useful in OBHR101 and are not intended to be used as exam notes._

Throughout our lives, we encounter people who seem to be natural leaders. They talk and behave in a way that makes others willing to listen to them. They seem to be born with great personal charisma and the ability to easily resolve any conflicts. 

In Organizational Behaviour, we examine the various aspects of effective leadership from a scientific perspective. We begin each topic by identifying a common issue that hinders workplace efficiency or effective collaboration. Then, we find solutions to the issue by cleverly exploiting some empirically proven human behavioural patterns.

The most classic example cited is usually the  <a href="https://sparq.stanford.edu/solutions/opt-out-policies-increase-organ-donation" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sparq.stanford.edu/solutions/opt-out-policies-increase-organ-donation">&#8220;organ donation&#8221;</a> example.

# 2 The Common Knowledge Effect {#2_the_common_knowledge_effect}

## 2.1 Issue {#21_issue}

The common knowledge effect is the phenomenon that team members tend to **focus their discussion on shared information** instead of information not previously known by all.

Usually, groups are expected to make better decisions than individuals acting alone because of their ability to take into account more information from diverse sources. Each member acts as a different informational resource to the group and can be pooled to produce a group quality of higher quality than any individual could have produced. However, if groups do not pool individual information effectively, they might not be able to significantly outperform an individual.

## 2.2 Solution {#22_solution}

<p id="221_increase_task_conflict">
  The key to reducing common knowledge effect is to **increase task conflict**.
</p>

Task conflict is a conflict in understanding that occurs when there are **perceived disagreements** among group members **about the content of their decisions**, which involves differences in viewpoints, ideas and opinions. Ways to induce task conflict include:

  * Appoint a devil's advocate (a person who is assigned to explicitly search for differences and promote critical disucssion)
  * Enforcing some virtuality
  * Structuring the discussion to analyse all options
      * e.g. asking the group to rank candidates instead of choose one to nominate
      * e.g. give a hidden profile task where the optimal decision is hidden and each member gets separate pieces of information
  * Create a norm of critical approach to discussion
      * e.g. task the group to &#8220;debate on an issue&#8221; vs &#8220;work together to create a poster&#8221; (i.e. it is fine not to reach a consensus)

# 3 Relationship Conflict {#3_relationship_conflict}

## 3.1 Issue {#31_issue}

Relationship conflict refers to tension, annoyance and animosity between people that can emerge in groups when there is perceived incompatibility between group members **(i.e. surface level differences)**. Experiments have shown that demographic diversity in teams sometimes lose the benefits from task-related diversity.

## 3.2 Solution {#32_solution}

### 3.2.1 Overarching Identity {#321_overarching_identity}

One interesting experiment that shown the significance of a overarching identity. In this experiments, random students who were Manchester United fans took a survey on being a MU / football fan. They then observed a fake accident where the student wore a particular T-shirt. The results are shown below:<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular">

<table class="has-fixed-layout">
  <tr>
    <th class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">

      70%
    </td>
  </tr>
</table><figcaption>Percentage of students who helped the injured confederate</figcaption></figure> 

This results shows how an overarching identity breaks down the lower-level group differences (i.e. focus on commonalities instead on differences).

### 3.2.2 Superordinate Goals / Interdependence {#322_superordinate_goals__interdependence}

When one's performance is dependent on team performance, members easily unite to achieve a common goal.

### 3.2.3 Assimilation vs Multiculturalism {#323_assimilation_vs_multiculturalism}

Assimilation / colour-blindness assumes that we are all the same. Multiculturalism respects differences. In real world, instilling multiculturalism works better.

### 3.2.4 Control Mentorship Networks {#324_control_mentorship_networks}

Experiments show that one of the most important factors in career success is good mentorship.

## 3.3 Deep Level Diversity {#33_deep_level_diversity}

The MBTI is the most popular personality test in the world. However, it is heavily criticized based on the four criteria: reliable (people get different results each time), valid (not linked to real world outcome), independent (black and white and not a scale, don't have average case either) and comprehensive (only 4 aspects of personality dimension) categories.

Teacher recommends the Big 5 Test haha.

# 4 Decision Making and Biases {#4_decision_making_and_biases}

## 4.1 Biases {#41_biases}

In decision making, it is immensely helpful to be aware of natural human biases and avoid reaching the wrong decision.

### 4.1.1 Selection Bias {#411_selection_bias}

Selection bias, or the problem of under-sampling of failure makes us **see only a selection of the outcomes**. E.g. we give different responses when we are asked on a scale of 4 how happy we are vs how unhappy we are. E.g. probability of smokers getting lung cancer is 0.056%. However, when compared to non-smoker, it is actually 7 times higher. 

It is important to avoid bench-marking, or comparing performance metrics to the average. We often find patterns from successful examples and conclude that those patterns lead to success. However, we ignored the fact that those exact same patterns might equally likely result in a failure. This is also why we believe charismatic people make good leader, or risk-taking leads to better performance.

To control selection bias, we need to train ourselves to pay attention to **graveyard samples**.

### 4.1.2 Default Choice Preference {#412_default_choice_preference}

Human tend to **prefer the default option** when we are **unsure** what to choose. Being unaware of such a behaviour will leave us **prone to manipulation** by others.

### 4.1.3 Sunk Cost Bias {#413_sunk_cost_bias}

Sunk cost bias, or escalation of commitment is a behaviour pattern in which a individual or a group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action or investment **nevertheless continues the same behaviour rather than alter course**. E.g. we refuse to give up on a project due to time / money already spent because of self-esteem issues. Experiments have shown that humans then to make decisions based on sunk cost (e.g. reduce investments on a failing project from 10M to 7M instead of cutting it to a reasonable budget based on performance alone).

Mitigation strategies include:

  * **Focusing** only on the **future**
  * Change the social meaning of failure (e.g. **encourage failing** fast and cheap)
  * **Disengaging** (use an external party to reassess, appointing devil's advocate, doing a postmortem)

### 4.1.4 Overconfidence Bias {#414_overconfidence_bias}

Overconfidence bias is a bias in which a person's subjective confidence in his or her judgements is reliably greater than the objective accuracy of those judgements. E.g. we always think car accidents only happen to others.

To control positive illusions, we need to **disengage**. We need to seek and internalize external, constructive feedback.

## 4.2 Diffusion of Responsibility {#42_diffusion_of_responsibility}

Case Study: Kennedy's case of Bay of Pigs.

Diffusion of responsibility is a phenomenon whereby a person is **less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when others are present**. Social loading is the tendency of individuals to put forth less effort when they are part of a group due to feelings of responsibility.

Mitigation strategies include:

  * Controlling **group size** (experimentally, most effective team size is around 5 people)
  * Assign **specific responsibility** (e.g. CPR training)
  * Foster group **cohesion**
  * More interdependence or mutual **evaluations**
  * Have more women (especially Asians) in the group (weird experimental finding lol, but seems true)

# 5 Science of Persuasion (MY FAV!) {#5_science_of_persuasion_my_fav}

Book: Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

Case Study: 12 Angry Man ⬅ WATCH IT!

## 5.1 Conformity {#51_conformity}

Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in belief or behaviour in order to fit in with a group in response to real / imagined group pressure. Famous experiment involves actors in a lift all standing in some weird directions and innocent others follow the group's silly turns.

### 5.1.1 Conformity as Procedural Tactic {#511_conformity_as_procedural_tactic}

Public vote if we want conformity, private vote if we want unique individual opinions

### 5.1.2 Conformity as Interpersonal Communication Tactic {#512_conformity_as_interpersonal_communication_tactic}

Conversational (&#8220;we all agree&#8221;, &#8220;star employees do it&#8221;) / behavioural references to influence other people's behaviour. E.g. hotel request cards should say &#8220;75% of guests participate...&#8221;.

## 5.2 Credibility {#52_credibility}

Credibility is a trait people need if they want to be followed by others. People **follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts** (e.g. physiotherapists are able to persuade more of their patients to comply with the recommended exercise program if they display their medical diplomas on the walls of their consulting rooms). But how do we build credibility without going around showing off all your diplomas.

### 5.2.1 Establishing Credibility {#521_establishing_credibility}

  * Highlight **unbiased agenda**
      * identify other's personal agenda (to show that you are the one who is here to work on the proper issue), e.g. highlight the fact that someone is off topic during a meeting (in a proper way)
  * Superficial cues
      * Calm and composed
      * Do not display excessive **emotions**
  * Use **questions** rather than statements
      * Reduce reactance (persuasion aversion)
      * Appear more interested and focused on the issue (put words in other's mouth)

## 5.3 Commitment and Consistency {#53_commitment_and_consistency}

Commitment and consistency are activated by looking for, and asking for, **small initial commitments** that can be made (in one famous set of studies, researchers found that very few people would be willing to erect an unsightly wooden board on their front lawn to support a Drive Safely campaign in their neighbourhood; however in a similar neighbourhood close by, four times as many homeowners indicated that they would be willing to erect this unsightly billboard because ten days previously, they had agreed to place a small postcard in the front window of their homes that signalled their support for a Drive Safely campaign). In summary, people like to stay consistent, similar to sunk cost bias, and this can be manipulated.

### 5.3.1 Making Others Committed {#531_making_others_committed}

The key is to verbalize and start acting (small) on something fast.

  * Ask the other party to **explain and verbalize** his / her passion
  * Start with **small initial commitment** and scale up (e.g. sign pledges)

## 5.4 Reciprocity {#54_reciprocity}

The reciprocity rule says that in many social situations we **pay back what we received from others;** **people feel obliged to give back to others** the form of a behaviour, gift, or service that they have received first (if a friend invites you to their party, there’s an obligation for you to invite them to a future party you are hosting; if a colleague does you a favour, then you owe that colleague a favour); in the context of a social obligation people are more likely to say yes to those who they owe.

In a study, restaurants investigate the relationship between giving free mints at the end of the meal to the amount of tips. Giving 1 mint led to a 3% increase in tips and 2 mints resulted in a 14% increase. Interesting, if waiter gives one mint, walks away, and return saying &#8220;for you nice people, here is another mint&#8221;, the tips increase by 23%. Hence, its **not just what is given but also how it is give.**

The key here, hence, is to **be the first to give, and give it in a personalized and surprising manner.** When others thank you, **DONT SAY** &#8220;oh it's no big deal&#8221;, say &#8220;of course, this is what partners do for each other&#8221;. We are given serious persuasive power immediately after someone thanks us.

## 5.5 Social Proof {#55_social_proof}

Social proof is a phenomenon where people **assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behaviour in a given situation**; it is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behaviour, and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation.

# 6 Power and Social Status {#6_power_and_social_status}

## 6.1 Bases of power {#61_bases_of_power}

  1. **Expert power:** possession of valued information, knowledge, ability, expertise or skills
  2. **Reward power:** ability to provide valued resources
  3. **Referent power**: status/ respect
  4. **Legitimate or positional power:** formal authority / hierarchy
  5. **Coercive power:** ability to punish

## 6.2 Interpersonal Tactics to Increase Power / Status {#62_interpersonal_tactics_to_increase_power__status}

### 6.2.1 Perceived Generosity {#621_perceived_generosity}

Research has shown that people who are perceived as **generous**, friendly or **helpful** are likely rewarded with higher social status (i.e. referent power). Also, people who are **self-monitoring** (i.e. aware of their own image in front of others) are more likely to be perceived as generous.

### 6.2.3 Emotions {#623_emotions}

In a negotiation, expressing an **angry emotion** is more effective in lowering opponent's **demand level** compared to being neutral or happy. However, it is important to note that it is usually men who are rewarded by showing anger. Women tend to be deemed inappropriate when expressing anger.

### 6.2.4 Personality {#624_personality}

Research has shown that **extroversion** is the most important factor contributing to status within a group (for both gender). Aside from this, **neuroticism** and **physical attractiveness** are also significant factors for men (physical attractiveness here refers to success rate in dating, which might explain why it does not work for women).

On the other hand, **conscientiousness**, **openness** to experience and **agreeableness** do not seem to correlate with status. 

### 6.2.5 Red Sneaker Effect (Nonconformity) {#625_red_sneaker_effect_nonconformity}

Sometimes **nonconformity**, especially when it seems **intentional**, suggest a higher status to others. This is because other might perceive you to be in a position of power to ignore norms and customs (e.g. profs wearing jeans).

### 6.2.6 Prosocial Norm Violation {#626_prosocial_norm_violation}

Another research shows that violating norms can improve one's power and status. However, only **prosocial norm violations** demonstrate such a correlation, selfish violations are not correlated with power.

## 6.3 Desire for Power {#63_desire_for_power}

### 6.3.1 Gender Differences {#631_gender_differences}

Research shows that women perceive high power as less desirable in general (but just as attainable). This also means that women are less likely to treasure opportunities for career advancement.

### 6.3.2 Background Differences {#632_background_differences}

People from less privileged backgrounds are less interested in power because they feel less comfortable engaging in political behaviour.

## 6.4 Consequences of power {#64_consequences_of_power}

  1. Less likely to consider other people's point of view
  2. Lower ability to detect others' emotions
  3. Illusion of personal control, thinking that they can control something beyond their ability [e.g. choose to roll the die themselves or let other roll for them]
  4. Tendency not to seek or ignore advice, also do not weigh expert advice more than amateur advice because they consider themselves as competitive
  5. Power and sex: people in position thinks that whoever they are interested in will likely be interested in them (the effect is not observed when the other party is ostentatiously engaged)
