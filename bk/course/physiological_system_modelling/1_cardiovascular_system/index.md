# 1 Overview

Beyond a distance of a few cell diameters, diffusion is too slow to meet the metabolic requirements of cells. The cardiovascular system is responsible for transporting molecules and other substances rapidly over the long distances between cells, tissues and organs. It consists of a pump (the heart), a set of interconnected tubes (blood vessels) and a fluid connective tissue containing water, solutes and cells that fills the tubes (blood).

</div>

Blood is composed of **formed elements** (cells and cell fragments) suspended in a liquid called **plasma**.

**Dissolved in plasma**

- proteins
- nutrients
- hormones
- mineral electrolytes
- metabolic wastes
- other molecules being transported

**Suspended in plasma**

- erythrocytes (red blood cells) [over 99% of blood cells]
  - carry oxygen to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues
- leukocytes (white blood cells)
  - protect against infection and cancer
- platelets (cell fragments)
  - blood clotting

**Hematocrit:** percentage of blood volume that is erythrocytes.

### 1.1.2 Plasma

**Plasma Proteins:** constitute most of the plasma solutes by weight. Responsible for exerting osmotic pressure that favours the absorption of extracellular fluid into capillaries.

**Types of Plasma Proteins**

- Albumins
  - most abundant and synthesised by the liver
- Globulins
- Fibrinogen
  - functions in clotting

**Serum:** plasma with fibrinogen and other proteins involved in clotting removed.

</div>

All blood cells are descended from a single population of cells called **multipotent hematopoietic stem cells**, which are undifferentiated cells capable of giving rise to precursors of any blood cells.

### 1.1.4 Erythrocytes

**Function**

- Gas transport
- Contains large amounts of **hemoglobin** protein to which oxygen and carbon dioxide reversibly combine (oxygen binds to $Fe^{2+}$)
- Average hemoglobin concentration - women : 14g/100mL, men: 15.5g/100mL

**Production**

- Produced in red bone marrow
- Erythrocyte precursor lose nuclei and organelles in differentiation
- Young erythrocytes (reticulocyte, less than a day) still contain few ribosomes which produce a weblike / reticular appearance when treated with special stain
- Reticulocytes constitute only 1% of circulating erythrocytes
- Average life span of 120 days, (1% or 250 billion cells produced per day)
- Destruction of damaged or dying erythrocytes happen in spleen and liver
- Major breakdown product of hemoglobin is bilirubin, returned to circulation and gives plasma yellowish colour

**Iron**

- Iron is the element to which oxygen binds on a hemoglobin molecule within an erythrocyte
- Iron are lost through urine, faeces, sweat, cells sloughed from the skin and menstrual blood
- Disruption of iron balance leads to **iron deficiency** or **hemochromatosis** (excess)
- Homeostatic control of iron balance resides in intestinal epithelium which actively absorbs iron from ingested food (proportion of absorption controlled via negative feedback)
- Iron in body stored in liver, bound up in a protein called **ferritin**, which buffers against iron deficiency (50% in hemoglobin, 25% in other heme-containing protein like cytochromes, 25% in liver ferritin)
- Recycling of iron is very efficient. When old erythrocytes are destroyed in the spleen, iron is released into plasma and bound to iron-transport plasma protein called **trasferrin** (delivers almost all of this iron to bone marrow). Recycled iron is 20 times more than absorbed iron.

**Folic Acid and Vitamin $B_{12}$**

- Folid acid is a vitamin found in large amounts in leafy plants, yeast and liver
- Required for synthesis of nucleotide base thymine
- Essential for formation of DNA and normal cell division
- Deficiency leads to impairment of cell division throughout the body especially in rapidly proliferating cells, including erythrocyte precursors
- Production of normal erythrocyte requires extremely small quantities of cobalt-containing molecule vitamin $B_{12}$ (cobalamin) for the action of folic acid
- Only found in animal products and strictly vegetarian diets can be deficient in it
- Absorption of vitamin $B_{12}$ from gastrointestinal tract requires protein called **intrinsic factor** secreted by the stomach
- Lack of this protein leads to **pernicious anemia** (vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency)

**Hormones**

- Direct control of erythropoiesis is exerted primarily by a hormone called erythropoietin secreted into the blood mainly by hormone-secreting connective tissue cells in kidneys
- Erythropoietin secretion rate inversely proprtional to oxygen delivery to kidney (e.g. insufficient pumping of blood, lung disease, anemia, prolonged exercise, exposure to high altitude
- Testosterone also stimulates release of erythropoietin (hence higher hematocrit in men than in women)

**Anemia**

- Decrease in the ability of the blood to carry oxygen due to
  - Dietary deficiencies of iron (iron-deficiency anemia), vitamin $B_{12}$, folic acid
  - Bone marrow failure due to toxic drugs or cancer
  - Blood loss from body (hemorrhage)
  - Inadequate secretion of erythropoietin in kidney
  - Excessive destruction of erythrocytes (e.g. Sickle-cell disease)
- **Sickle-cell Disease**
  - Due to genetic mutation that alters one amino acid in hemoglobain chain
  - At low oxygen levels in many capillaries, abnormal hemoglobin interact with each otehr to form fiberlike polymers that distort the erythrocyte membrane and cause the cell to form sickle shapes or other bizarre forms
  - Causes blockage or capillaries with consequent tissue damage and pain, and destruction of the deformed erythrocytes with consequent anemia
  - Only manifested fully in people homozygous for the mutated gene (two copies of mutated genes, one form each parent)
  - Heterozygotes (one mutated, one normal) are said to have sickle-cell trait. In this case symptoms only observed when oxygen level is unusually low, e.g. at high altitudes
  - Persistence of sickle-cell mutation in humans because heterozygotes are more resistance to malaria
- **Polycythemia:** too much erythrocytes. Viscosity of blood increases and puts strain on heart (e.g. high altitude dwellers, competitive bicyclists, synthetic erythropoietin abuse)

### 1.1.5 Leukocytes

- **Neutrophils:** phagocytes and most abundant leukocytes. Found in blood but leave capillaries and enter tissues during inflammation. After neutrophils engulf microbes such as bacteria, bacteria are destroyed within endocytotic vacuoles by proteases, oxidising compounds and antibacterial proteins called **defensins**
- **Eosinophils:** found in blood and in the mucosal surfaces lining the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urinary tracts. Fight off invasions by eukaryotic parasites. In some cases act by releasing toxic chemicals that kill parasites, else by phagocytosis
- **Monocytes:** phagocytes that circulate in the blood for a short time then migrate into tissues and organs and develop into macrophages
- **Macrophages:** strategically located where they will encounter invaders, including epithelia in contact with the external environment. They are large phagocytes capable of engulfing viruses and bacteria
- **Basophils:** secretory cells, secrete an anticlotting factor called heparin at the site of an infection, which helps the circulation flush out the infected site. Also secretes histamine which attracts infection-fighting cells and proteins to the site
- **Lymphocytes:** T- and B-lymphocytes. Protect against specific pathogens including viruses, bacteria, toxins and cancer cells. Some lymphocytes directly kill pathogens and others secrete antibodies into the circulation that bind to foreign molecules and begin the process of their destruction.
