# 1 Overview

The cardiovascular system consists of three principal components: **heart, blood vessels and blood**.

</div>

**Blood** is essentially **formed elements** (cells and cell fragments) suspended in liquid called **plasma** (large number of proteins, nutrients, metabolic wastes and other molecules being transported between organ systems).

The average volume of blood in a 70kg person is 5.5L. At any given moment, around 5% of blood is in capillaries. The flow of blood is produced by pressure created by pumping action of the heart (bulk flow since all constituents of blood move in one direction).

# 2 Two Circulatory Circuits

There are two circulatory circuits in the cardiovascular system, both orginating and terminating in the heart:

- **Systemic circulation:** blood pumped from **left ventricle** through **all the organs and tissues** of the body except the lungs, then to the **right atrium**
- **Pulmonary circulation:** blood pumped from **right ventricle** to the **lungs** then to the **left atrium**

The flow of blood goes through vessels of different diameters throughout the circuit:

</div>

- **Arteries**: carry blood away from the heart
- **Veins**: carry blood back towards the heart
- **Arterioles, capilliaries and venules** are collectively termed **microcirculation**

The following picture gives an overview of the structure of the heart:

</div>

## 2.1 Systemic Circuit

The systemic circuit follows the path: left ventricle ➜ aorta ➜ arterioles ➜ capillaries ➜ venules ➜ veins ➜ inferior vena cava (collects blood below the heart) and superior vena cava (collects blood above the heart) ➜ right atrium

## 2.2 Pulmonary Circuit

The pulmonary circuit follows the path: right ventricle ➜ pulmonary trunk ➜ 2 pulmonary arteries (right vs left lungs) ➜ capillaries ➜ 4 pulmonary veins ➜ left atrium

## 2.3 Macrovessels

- **Aorta** - diameter 25mm, wall thickness 2mm
- **Artery** - diameter 4mm, wall thickness 1mm
- **Vein** - diameter 5mm, wall thickness 0.5mm
- **Vena Cava** - diameter 30mm, wall thickness 1.5mm

## 2.4 Microvessels

- **Arteriole** - diameter 30um, wall thickness 6um
- **Terminal arteriole** - diameter 10um, wall thickness 2um
- **Capillary** - diameter 8um, wall thickness 0.5um
- **Venule** - diameter 20um, wall thickness 1um

# 3 Mechanical Events of the Cardiac Cycle

## 3.1 Heart Wall

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="277" height="287" src="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1.png?resize=277%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1066" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Heart wall</figcaption></figure>
</div>

- Outer walls: **myocardium**
- Inner surface: **endocardium**

## 3.2 Valves

Valves in the heart controls blood flow. It allows blood to flow in the forward direction with very little resistance when they are open (little pressure difference across required for large flow), and prevents blood from flowing backwards when pressure difference is reversed.

- **Atrioventricular (AV) valves:** permites blood to flow from atrium to ventricle
  - **Tricuspid valve:** right AV valve
  - **Bicuspid valve:** left AV valve
  - opening and closing of AV valves is a passive process due to pressure difference across the valves
  - fastened to muscular projections (papillary muscles) of the ventricular walls
- **Pulmonary valve:** opening from right ventricle to pulmonary trunk
- **Aortic valve:** opening from left ventricle to aorta

## 3.3 Systole

**Systole** is the phase of **ventricular contraction** and **blood ejection**. It lasts for around 0.3s.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="582" height="326" src="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.png?resize=582%2C326&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1068" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.png?w=582&ssl=1 582w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.png?resize=300%2C168&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.png?resize=580%2C325&ssl=1 580w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.png?resize=320%2C179&ssl=1 320w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Systole</figcaption></figure>
</div>

- **Isovolumetric ventricular contraction**
  - ventricular volume constant (because blood is incomperessible)
  - ventricular walls develop tension and squeezing on the blood they enclose
- **Ventricular ejection**
  - raising pressure in the ventricles exceed that in the aorta and pulmonary trunk ➜ aortic and pulmonary valves open
  - stroke volume: volume of blood ejected from each ventricle during systole

## 3.4 Diastole

**Diastole** is the phase of **ventricular relaxation** and **blood filling**. It lasts around 0.5s.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="287" src="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?resize=720%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1069" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?w=825&ssl=1 825w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?resize=300%2C120&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?resize=768%2C306&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?resize=720%2C287&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?resize=580%2C231&ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png?resize=320%2C128&ssl=1 320w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Diastole</figcaption></figure>
</div>

- **Isovolumetric ventricular relaxation**
- **Ventricular filling**
- **Atrial contraction**
  - about 80% of ventricular filling occurs before atrial contraction

## 3.5 Cardiac Cycle

Each cardiac cycle consist of a Systole and a Diastole, lasting around 0.8s, or 72 beats per minute.

## 3.6 Blood Pressure

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="383" height="332" src="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.png?resize=383%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1070" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.png?w=383&ssl=1 383w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.png?resize=300%2C260&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.png?resize=320%2C277&ssl=1 320w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Blood pressure</figcaption></figure>
</div>

### 3.6.1 **Mid-diastole to late diastole (Ventricular Filling)**

- left atrium and ventricle both relaxed
- atrial pressure is slightly higher than ventricular pressure
- AV valve forced open and blood enter atrium from pulmonary veins and continue to ventricle
- aortic valve closed
- aortic pressure slowly falling because blood is moving out of the arteries and through vascular system
- ventricular pressure rising slightly because blood is entering the relaxed ventricle from the atrium
- end-diastolic volume: amount of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole

### 3.6.2 **Systole**

- ventricle contracts and ventricular pressure rises very rapidly
- almost immediately exceeds the atrial pressure, closing AV valve and preventing back-flow into atrium
- ventricle cannot empty despite contraction due to closed aortic valve
- when ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure, aortic valve opens and ventricular ejection occurs
- ventricle does not empty completely (end-systolic volume)
- stroke volume (avg. 70ml) = end diastolic volume (avg. 135ml) - end systolic volume (avg. 65ml)
- small pressure differences between ventricle and aorta because of open aortic valve during ejection
- peak ventricular and aortic pressures reached before end of ventricular ejection despite continued ventricular contraction because ejection rate is less than rate at which blood is leaving aorta

### 3.6.3 **Early diastole**

- begins when ventricular muscle begins to relax after contraction and ejection stop
- aortic valve closes as ventricular pressure falls significantly below aortic pressure immediately
- but ventricular pressure still exceeds atrial pressure and AV valve remains closed
- isovolumetric ventricular relaxation ends as ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure
- some energy is stored within the myocardium during contraction and its release during relaxation aids filling (and can even create negative pressure)
- fact that most of ventricular filling is completed during early diastole ensures that filling is not seriously impaired when heart is beating very rapidly (inadequate filling time when heart rate exceeds around 200 bpm)

### 3.6.4 Heart Sound

Heart sound results from cardiac contraction are normally heard through a stethoscope placed on the chest wall. The first sound is associated with the closure of AV valves. The second, louder sound is associated with the closure of pulmonary and aortic valves.

### 3.6.5 Pressures

- **Systolic pressure:** maximum arterial pressure reached during peak ventricular ejection
- **Diastolic pressure:** minimum arterial pressure just before ventricular ejection begins
- **Pulse pressure:** difference between systolic and diastolic pressure
  - most important determinants of pulse pressure
    - stroke volume
    - speed of ejection
    - arterial compliance
- **Mean arterial pressure:** MAP = DP + 1/3(SP - DP) because diastole lasts longer than systole (describes pressure driving blood into the tissues averaged over the entire cardiac cycle)

# 4 Electrical Activity of the Heart

## 4.1 Electrical Behaviour of Single Cardiac Muscle Cell

The wall of the heart primarily consist of cardiac muscles called myocardium. Electrical behaviour investigated by inserting micro-electrodes into the interior of cells.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

- **Point a:** two electrodes placed in electrolyte solution near strip of cardiac muscle ➜ no p.d.
- **Point b:** one electrode inserted into interior of cardiac muscle fibre ➜ around -90mV resting membrane potential
- **Point c:** cardiac muscle cell excited
  - **Phase 0:** rapid upstroke of action potential because cell membrane is depolarised rapidly (precedes force development)
  - **Phase 1:** partial repolarisation
  - **Phase 2:** plateau for 0.1-0.2 seconds
  - **Phase 3:** potential progressively repolarises (much slower than phase 0)
  - **Phase 4**: end of repolarisation
    - coincides approximately with peak force

## 4.2 Types of Action Potential

- **Fast response:** ordinary atrial, ventricular myocytes and specialized conducting fibres
- **Slow response:** sinoatrial (SA) nodes, natural pacemaker, atrioventricular (AV) node (specialized tissue that conducts the cardiac impulse from atria to ventricles)

It is interesting to note that the resting membrane potential of fast response more negative than that of slow response. Also, the slope of phase 0 upstroke and amplitude and extent of overshoot of fast response greater than those of slow response (amplitude and slope determines propagation velocity).

## 4.3 Explanation of Resting Potential

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="288" height="207" src="https://i1.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2.png?resize=288%2C207&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1078" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Cell membrane permeability</figcaption></figure>
</div>

Phases of cardiac action potential are associated with changes in permeability of cell membrane (mainly to sodium, potassium and calcium ions) ➜ defines net quantity of ion that will diffuse across each unit area of membrane per unit concentration difference across the membrane (achieved by opening and closing of ion channels that are specific for individual ions).

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="691" height="128" src="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.png?resize=691%2C128&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1079" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.png?w=691&ssl=1 691w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.png?resize=300%2C56&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.png?resize=580%2C107&ssl=1 580w, https://i2.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.png?resize=320%2C59&ssl=1 320w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Ion concentrations</figcaption></figure>
</div>

Concentration of potassium ions inside cardiac (or any general) cell greatly exceeds that outside the cell (reverse concentration gradient exists for sodium and calcium ions, and is not bound to protein).

- Resting cell membrane is relatively permeable to $K^+$ but less so to $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$
- Flux of $K^+$ that occurs during phase 4 takes place through certain specific $K^+$ channels (some controlleds by transmembrane potential, others controlled by chaical signals)
- Two opposing forces involved in movement of $K^+$ across cell membrane
  - chemical force based on concentration gradient ➜ net outward flow
  - electrostatic force based on positive charge and negative potential ➜ net inward flow
  - equilibrium governed by Nernst equation for potassiums $E\_K = -61.5log\frac{[K^+]\_i}{[K^+]\_o}$ ($E\_K$ is equilibrium potential of potassium, around -94mV compared to -90mV normally measured)
  - actual resting potential measured is slightly less negative than -94mV because of small inward current of $Na^+$ (not very permeable but negative potential compared to $Na^+$ equilibrium potential of 70mV)

## 4.4 Explanation of Change in Action Potential

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="688" height="148" src="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.png?resize=688%2C148&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1084" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.png?w=688&ssl=1 688w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.png?resize=300%2C65&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.png?resize=580%2C125&ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/ppeetteerrsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.png?resize=320%2C69&ssl=1 320w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure>
</div>

- **Genesis of the upstroke**
  - rapid depolarization (phase 0) almost exclusively due to inrush of $Na^+$ by virtue of sudden increase in conductance of $Na^+$
  - when resting membrane potential is suddenly changed to -65mV, voltage-dependent channels (fast $Na^+$) channels allow inrush of $Na^+$
- **Genesis of early repolarization**
  - activation of transient outward current mostly carried by $K^+$
- **Genesis of the plateau**
  - $Ca^{2+}$ enters the cell through calcium channels that activate and inactivate much more slowly than the fast $Na^+$ channel
  - influx of $Ca^{2+}$ balanced by efflux of $K^+$
- **Genesis of final repolarization**
  - efflux of $K^+$ from cardiac cell exceeds influx of $Ca^{2+}$
- **Slow response**
  - phase 0 much less steep (fast $Na^+$ channels blocked by certain compounds)
  - phase 1 absent
  - phase 2 is brief and not flat
  - phase 3 is not separated very distinctly from phase 2

# 5 Heart Beat Coordination

## 5.1 Overview

- heart is a dual pump such that left and right sides of the heart pump blood separately, but simultaneously into the systemic and pulmonary circuits
- efficient pumping requires atria contraction followed almost immediately by the ventricle
- contraction of cardiac muscle is triggered by depolarisation of membrane (action potential spreads from one cell to another cell, initial excitation of one cardiac cell evetually results in the excitation of all cardiac cells)
- initial depolarization normally arises in a small group of conducting system cells (sinoatrial node) located in the right atrium near the entrance of superior vena cava

- SA node is the normal pacemaker of the entire heart
- action potential initiated by SA node spread throughout the myocardium
- spread throughout right atrium and from right atrium to the left does not depend on fibres of the conducting system
  - conduction through atrial muscle cells is rapid enough that two atria are depolarized and contract at essentially the same time
- spread of action potential to ventricles is more complicated and involves rest of the conducting system
  - link between atrial depolarization and ventricular depolarization is a portion of the conducting system called atrioventricular (AV) node
  - propagation of action potentials through the AV node is relatively slow (allowing the atrial contraction to be completed before ventricular excitation occurs)
  - after leaving AV node, impulse enters the wall (inter-ventricular septum between two ventricles)
  - atrioventricular bundle / bundle of His: pathway of conducting fibre in inter-ventricular septum
  - AV node and AV bundle are the only electrical link between atria and ventricles, other than that, atria is completely separated from ventricles by layer of non-conducting connective tissue
  - AV bundle divides into right and left bundle branches => leaves the septum and make contact with large conducting cells Purkinje fibres that rapidly distributes the impulse throughout most of the ventricles

SA node cell does not have a steady resting membrane potential => undergoes slow depolarisation (pacemaker potential) => brings membrane potential to threshold, at which point an action potential occurs.

</div>

- before threshold

  - progressive reduction in potassium permeability (potassium channels opened during repolarisation phase of previous action potential gradually close due to return of negative membrane potential)
  - pacemaker cells have unique set of channels that open when the membrane potential is at negative values ➜ conduct inward, depolarisation sodium current
  - pacemaker also has a type of calcium channel that opens only briefly but contributes an inward calcium current (T-type calcium channels) that boost the depolarisation

- after the threshold ➜ action potential occurs
  - depolarising phase: calcium influx through T-type calcium channels and after a delay, opening of potassium channels repolarizes the membrane

- P wave
  - current flows during atrial depolarisation
  - end of diastole when SA node discharges
- QRS complex
  - approximately 0.15 seconds after P wave
  - ventricular depolarisation
  - atrial repolarisation is usually not evident but occurs at the same time
- T wave
  - ventricular repolarisation
  - diastole begins as ventricular contraction and ejection stops

# 6 Pressure, Flow, Resistance, Compliance

## 6.1 Overview
